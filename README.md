CSS sample that demonstrates layout of marketing testimonial page

Our client, Evergreen Home Loans, wanted to create a reusable testimonial page. I used HTML5 and CSS to layout the page, and Wordpress to create the client-side form that allows the client to upload new images and text to update the page.
